## Workflows

### E2E Tests (`docker-compose-test-e2e-full-setup.yaml`)

Runs on pushes to `main` that touch `docker-compose/versions/**`, and on pull requests that touch version files, either E2E workflow, or anything under `.github/actions/**`.

- **init job**: Runs `generate-versions-matrix` to build an exclude list of unchanged versions (skip-if-unchanged optimization).
- **exec job**: Fans out across all version matrix entries; passes compose args, e2e flag, and test directory to the reusable template.
- Each matrix entry sets `name`, `camunda-version`, `main-compose-args`, and `e2e-test-enabled`; optional fields are `e2e-test-directory`, `e2e-test-args`, `deps-compose-args`, and `timeout-minutes`.
- E2E tests default to `docker-compose/test/e2e`; versions 8.8+ use their own `docker-compose/versions/camunda-X.Y/tests/` (full-stack) and `tests-lightweight/` (lightweight, `@camunda/e2e-test-suite` c8Run suite).
- Matrix entries marked ⭐ are the primary configs per version (full-stack with e2e enabled).

### E2E Test Template (`docker-compose-test-e2e-template.yaml`)

Reusable workflow called by the full-setup. Steps:
1. Checkout repo.
2. `install-playwright` composite action (Node 24, `npm ci`, `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`).
3. Start Docker Compose dependencies (`deps-compose-args`, if set), then the main services.
4. Wait for health checks.
5. Run `npx playwright test` with configured args.
6. Upload HTML report as artifact (30-day retention).

Job timeout defaults to 30 minutes. The 8.8–8.10 full-stack and lightweight entries use 45 minutes to leave room for container startup, long connector and webhook flows, and CI retries.

Playwright uses two retries and one worker in CI. Shared and full-stack suites launch the Chrome channel; lightweight suites launch Playwright Chromium.

### Release (`docker-compose-release.yaml`)

Triggers on push to `main` touching `docker-compose/versions/**`, or manual `workflow_dispatch` with `release-all` flag.

- Rolling release model: each Camunda minor version has exactly one release artifact (no versioned tags).
- **init job**: Generates changed-versions matrix (or all versions if `release-all=true`).
- **exec job**: `max-parallel: 1` — releases versions sequentially in order (8.4 → 8.10).
- Uses HashiCorp Vault for Docker registry credentials (DockerHub + `registry.camunda.cloud`).

### `generate-versions-matrix` Action

Located in `.github/actions/generate-versions-matrix/`.

- Compares changed files against `docker-compose/versions/camunda-8.*` paths.
- Outputs `unchanged` (JSON array of matrix excludes) and `should-run` (bool).
- Used by both test and release workflows to skip unaffected versions on PRs.

## Renovate

Configured via `.github/renovate.json5` and per-component overrides in `.github/config/renovatebot/`.

- **Patch-only automation**: Minor and major version bumps are disabled — only patches are auto-merged.
- **Excluded versions**: 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 are excluded from all updates.
- **Semantic commits enforced**: `deps(docker-compose)` or `deps(github-actions)` scope.
- Docker image updates and GitHub Actions updates are managed separately.

## Conventions

- All secrets via HashiCorp Vault — no GitHub Secrets, no hardcoded values.
- Reusable workflows (`*-template.yaml`) are called via `uses:` with `secrets: inherit`.
- Artifact retention: 30 days for Playwright HTML reports.
- `cancel-in-progress: true` on all workflow concurrency groups.
