# Camunda 8 Self-Managed - Docker Compose

A Docker Compose configuration to run Camunda Platform (e.g., Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, Optimize, Identity, Connectors Bundle, and Web Modeler).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Docker Compose is only recommended for local development.
> For production setups we recommend using [Camunda 8 SaaS](https://camunda.com/platform/), or [Camunda 8 Helm charts](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/install/).

## Supported Versions

Released Camunda versions:

- [Camunda 8.4](./versions/camunda-8.4)
- [Camunda 8.5](./versions/camunda-8.5)
- [Camunda 8.6](./versions/camunda-8.6)
- [Camunda 8.7](./versions/camunda-8.7)
- [Camunda 8.8](./versions/camunda-8.8)
- [Camunda 8.9](./versions/camunda-8.9)
- [Camunda 8.10](./versions/camunda-8.10)

Camunda `8.10` includes the same compose layouts as `8.9`, but Elasticsearch is no longer bundled and must be provided externally where needed.

## Keycloak Image Migration

Camunda 8.7–8.10 use the Camunda-maintained, Quay-based Keycloak image. If you previously started one of these versions with the Bitnami Legacy image, remove its existing volumes before starting the updated configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f <compose-file> down -v --remove-orphans
```

This command permanently deletes the local data stored by that Compose project. A fresh PostgreSQL volume is required because the database and user were renamed from the Bitnami-specific defaults to `keycloak`, and the PostgreSQL image only creates them during initial volume setup.

## Continuous Integration

The basic functionality of Docker Compose is continually tested using GitHub Actions and Playwright.

## Continuous Delivery

TBA.
